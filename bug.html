<p>This is a common HTML error, but often overlooked due to its subtle nature. It involves using a closing tag for an element that doesn't require a closing tag, or vice versa.</p> <p>Example: Incorrectly closing a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag.</p> <code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</code> <p>The <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag is a self-closing tag and does not require a closing tag.  Another frequent mistake occurs when not closing block level elements like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.</p> <code>&lt;div&gt;This div is not properly closed.&lt;p&gt;Neither is this paragraph.&lt;/div&gt;</code> <p>This can cause unexpected layout issues.  In some browsers it will appear to work correctly, but in others this might cause misalignments and unexpected visual breakages.</p>
